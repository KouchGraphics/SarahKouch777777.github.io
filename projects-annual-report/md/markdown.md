## *Jon Feltheimer Chief Executive Officer*

*Lionsgate (NYSE: LGF.A, LGF.B) is a global content leader whose films, television series, digital products and linear and over-the-top platforms reach next generation audiences around the world. Lionsgate’s film and television properties support location-based entertainment venues and other branded attractions, as well as a video game business. Lionsgate’s content initiatives are backed by a nearly 17,000-title film and television library and delivered through a global sales and licensing infrastructure.*

When the pandemic hit in March, we quickly transitioned our non-essential employees to work safely from home, redeployed resources according to the areas of greatest need, ensured that our businesses were positioned to continue delivering premium quality entertainment to the large at home audience and took immediate steps to conserve cash in order to protect a healthy balance sheet. As a result, we were able to mitigate many of the adverse impacts of the pandemic and resulting economic downturn. We enter fiscal 2021 with protocols in place to operate successfully in the “new normal,” full pipelines of film and television content ready to resume production, and a complete re-imagining of all of our businesses that positions them to emerge from the current environment stronger than ever.

Our Motion Picture Group, Driven By Strong Brands & Talent Relationships

Turning to our film business, we ranked among the top five studios in domestic box office market share last year as we created exciting new franchises like Knives Out, which earned multiple Academy Award® nominations on its way to grossing more than $300 million at the global box office, and extended blockbuster brands like The Hunger Games, John Wick, and Now You See Me with highly-anticipated new installments.

There are a number of uncertainties surrounding when theatres will re-open, how quickly moviegoers will return and when production can safely resume. But our confidence in the future of our theatrical business is undiminished, bolstered by the continued demand for movies across every kind of platform, the quality and excitement of the content we bring to our audiences and distribution partners, the flexibility built into our diverse portfolio of movies, and our longstanding ability to pivot quickly and change with a changing world.

Fiscal 2020 was also a strong growth year for two of our newer businesses. The PANTAYA platform continued to deliver on its promise as the premium streaming destination for Spanish-language movies and original programming, more than doubling its paid subscribers to over 700,000 and launching its first slate of original series.


Our location-based entertainment and live stage business continued to roll out around the world. Lionsgate Entertainment World in Hengqin, China, hailed as a pioneer in leading a new generation of vertically-designed indoor theme parks, reopened to strong attendance in June with many of the Company’s other branded attractions expected to resume operations soon.
In closing, the extraordinary circumstances of recent months have tested our resolve, ability to pivot quickly and willingness to embrace change and re-imagine every facet of how we do business. But our employees have risen to the challenge with resilience, resourcefulness and a “can do” collaborative team spirit, and we enter the new fiscal year in good shape operationally, strategically and financially.

And though the industry playbook continues to be rewritten on an almost daily basis, our own path forward is clear, guided by our “North Star” principles of focusing on those audiences with whom we have always connected successfully, creating content that is bold, original and stands out from the clutter, positioning ourselves where the puck is going, not where it has already been, and continuing to create a valuable, scalable, premium global streaming platform that is unlike anything else in the marketplace.

By continuing to adhere to those core principles, we will continue to build incremental long-term value for our employees, our partners and our shareholders.

* Our businesses could be impacted should the disruptions lead to changes in consumer behavior by decreasing our revenue and increasing our expenses.
